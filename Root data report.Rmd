#### Root images were taken by the automated Minirhizotron system in the field. Root length was estimated by a model based on convolutional neural network. Results of this report are derived from those estimated root length. This report is the final part of the fully automated workflow for Minirhizotron-based *in situ* root phenotyping: from image acquisition to analysis

#### **1. Root length density estimated by model**

This is the graph of root length density in different soil depth changing with date.
